# Customer Churn Analysis for Telecom Industry

Executive Summary:

This project aims to analyze customer churn data for a telecommunications company to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and patterns. By leveraging structured data stored in a MySQL database, the analysis provides valuable information to support data-driven decision-making processes, improve customer retention strategies, and enhance overall business performance.

Data Preparation:

The analysis begins with the creation of a database schema named "Customer_Churn" and a table named "Customer" containing various customer attributes such as demographic information, membership details, activity logs, and feedback. Appropriate data type assignments and constraints were implemented to ensure data integrity and consistency.

To address data quality issues, the code includes steps to handle missing or null values, replace ambiguous entries, and standardize data formats. For instance, null values in the "points_in_wallet" column were replaced with the average value, while ambiguous entries like "Both" in the "medium_of_operation" column were updated to a more descriptive value.

Data Normalization:

To ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy, the project employed database normalization techniques. The initial "Customer" table was decomposed into four separate tables: "Complaints," "Membership," "Customer_Preferences," and "Customer_Activity." This normalization process involved creating primary and foreign key relationships between the tables, establishing referential integrity constraints, and eliminating data duplication.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The EDA phase focused on deriving valuable insights from the customer data to support various business objectives, including:

1. Customer Segmentation and Targeted Marketing:
   - Customers were segmented based on demographic factors (age, gender), activity patterns (average transaction value, login frequency), preferences (offer types, medium of operation), and membership categories.
   - This segmentation enables the development of tailored marketing strategies, promotional offers, and communication channels for different customer groups.

2. Customer Retention and Churn Prevention:
   - By monitoring customer activity metrics (average time spent, days since last login), the analysis identified customers at risk of churning, enabling proactive measures for customer retention, such as offering incentives or addressing complaints.

3. Product and Service Improvement:
   - Analysis of customer complaints, feedback, and preferences provided insights into areas for improvement in products, services, or customer experience, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

4. Risk Assessment and Fraud Detection:
   - Monitoring customer activity patterns (average transaction value, login frequency) and security information (security number) enabled the identification of suspicious behavior or potential fraudulent activities, allowing for appropriate risk mitigation measures.

5. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis:
   - By combining customer demographic data, activity patterns, and transaction history, the project calculated the estimated lifetime value of each customer, enabling the prioritization of retention efforts for the most valuable customer segments.

6. Personalization and Recommendation Systems:
   - Leveraging customer preferences, activity patterns, and demographic data, the analysis provided recommendations for products, services, or content tailored to individual customers, enhancing customer experience and engagement.

Conclusion:

This project successfully demonstrated the value of structured data analysis in the telecommunications industry. By leveraging SQL queries and database normalization techniques, valuable insights were derived to support customer segmentation, retention strategies, product improvements, risk assessment, lifetime value calculations, and personalized recommendations. The findings from this analysis can empower the company to make informed decisions, optimize customer experiences, and drive business growth.
